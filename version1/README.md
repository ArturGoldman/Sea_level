# Sea_level
Brief file description:
1) Getfiles.ipynb - downloads data
2) Hand_distr.ipynb - plots data. 
3) project5.py - old version of the project. Contained several bugs. Worked really slow.
4) runner.py - special programme, which runs project5.py script
5) output_every.txt - contains previous sample, created by project5.py. It came out to be small and, therefore, irrelevant
